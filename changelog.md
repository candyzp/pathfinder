# beta 246

- Replaced rolling random candidate search with an incremental, state-deduplicated beam search.
- Added persistent alternate branches, adaptive horizons and compact simulation checkpoints.
- Added geometry-guided Wave corridor planning while retaining one-frame spam choices.

# beta 18
## Fix tons of bugs:

# beta 1-16
- Initial Release
